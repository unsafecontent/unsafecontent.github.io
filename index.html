        <p class="lead">Last night around 12 a.m., I was entrusted with a piece of confidential information from an old friend that shook me to my core. I knew in my heart this was not the sort of thing I could keep to myself, and I got the sense that my friend had confided in me precisely <em>because</em> he thought I'd spill the beans.</p>

        <p>
          The feeling is awful. Like being at the top of a ski slope you just aren't ready for.
        </p><p>
          It's one of those details where, once you have it, so many other things make sense. Recently, I'd begun to feel like everyone in U.S. politics had simultaneously lost touch with reality except me. Like I was in that episode of <em>Black Mirror</em> where criminals are punished by "wiping" their memory each morning and allowing tourists to scare confused inmates by wearing Halloween masks and threatening them with chainsaws.
        </p><p>
          So it's 1 a.m. in southern California and I'm sweating bullets, feeling as confused and alone as the protagonist in a sci-fi thriller. Moments ago, I received a text from a friend I haven't spoken to in years. He works in the machine learning group at a Silicon Valley social media giant. (I don't want to be much more specific for fear of him being dragged into all this.) In fact, we used to work together &mdash; that's how we know each other &mdash; but, unlike me, his specialty is natural language processing. If you need someone to build an algorithm to understand text written by a human, he's your guy.
        </p><p>
          When you build a machine learning algorithm &mdash; what some folks call "AI" in this setting &mdash; you start with what they call <em>training data</em>. This data is fed to the algorithm so it can "learn" the task at hand. For example, if you want to train an AI to find pictures with nudity, your training data would be a bunch of pictures and a tag for each one regarding whether it contained nudity. Simple.
        </p><p>
          So if you're an AI expert, someone comes to you with some training data, and you figure out the best AI for that problem domain. Different things work better for different problems, of course. So it is crucial for the researcher to understand <em>how the training data was obtained</em>. Without this information, he's doing his job blind.
        </p><p>
          Which brings me to my buddy. After years working in this group, he was assigned a project and his boss couldn't explain where they got the training data from, or what it even was. That's extremely weird. It makes the job much, much harder. I've heard of this with respect to big Wall Street firms who don't want any individual to know too much about their strategyâ€¦ but at a social media company? Unheard of.
        </p><p>
          So I'll need to be a bit vague here, but long story short my buddy does some investigative work and figures out it's an obfuscated version of another data set but restricted down to <em>just</em> text involving tweets about the Hunter Biden email scandal.
        </p><p>
          It seemed from what he could see that he was being asked to predict whether a given text description was talking positively or negatively about Joe Biden in the context of the Hunter Biden email scandal. And that really freaked him out. He began telling me about another data set that he'd worked on, ostensibly to build a "conservative detector" model. He assumed it was just for tailoring content to individual tastes, but now believes its purpose was likely as pernicious as whatever this new assignment was all about.
         </p>
        <p id="overview">
          The Hunter Biden email scandal is indisputably one of the most consequential corruption investigations of all time. Just weeks before an election, the New York <em>Post</em> exposes a trove of evidence  demonstrating conclusively that:
        </p>
        <ol class="in-article">
          <li>The Bidens have been selling their influence for decades, including to corrupt oligarchs seeking to manipulate U.S. foreign policy to bully their business or political adversaries;</li>
          <li>Joe Biden has engaged in fraudulent behavior by not disclosing the shares held in trust for him by Hunter, ostensibly to avoid questions about conflicts of interest;</li>
          <li>Joe Biden has been taking half of the payments made to Hunter in some under-the-table fashion, and this hasn't been properly declared on tax returns; and</li>
          <li>Perhaps worst of all, this corruption isn't just related to Russia and the Ukraine &mdash; the Chinese government has also purchased the Bidens' influence, which makes some of his oddly pro-China remarks seem more sensible. (Remember when he derided Trump's decision to close the border to China during the pandemic as "xenophobic" and "hysterical"?)</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Until recently, this was all based on the word of a tipster who purportedly came into possession of Hunter Biden's laptop &mdash; and, while it would take a lot of effort to fake the many pictures and emails released, it was still conceivably possible that the material wasn't genuine.
        </p><p id="validated">

But then Fox News was able to validate the emails are real by contacting some of the other recipients on them. They reported this on air &mdash; so if they were wrong, the Biden campaign would have a lawsuit against Fox News, one that would among other things force them to stop reporting on it. That, of course, hasn't happened. And now, days have gone by, and Joe Biden's campaign hasn't even tried to deny the veracity of the emails. Indeed, the campaign essentially admitted that they were genuine and that the meetings they discuss did in fact happen.
        </p><p id="coverup">

But that's not the scary part &mdash; politicians have been corrupt forever. The scary part is what happened next &mdash; a coordinated blackout between social media and mainstream media.
        </p><p>

First, Facebook "limited circulation" of the bombshell article. Twitter suspended the <em>Post</em>'s account and blocked anyone from sending the link, either via tweet or DM. After they came under fire from Congress, they removed that restriction but still left the article functionally blocked and the <em>Post</em>'s account suspended, as they refused to submit to Twitter's demand they take down their article.
        </p><p>

Then, days went by, and there was little-to-no mainstream reporting anywhere except Fox News, except of course for dismissive hot takes that lob the vague "Russian disinformation" accusation at everything we've mentioned.
        </p><p>

And while numerous sources have confirmed that these emails are real and are definitely not "disinformation," this Orwellian struggle to deny reality continues unabated.
        </p><p>
<strong>I repeat: there have been zero simple, factual articles on this in the mainstream media. And it is censored on social media.</strong>
        </p><p>

I knew those industries "leaned" toward the Democrats' side, but I thought we all had enough fundamental respect for the system of democracy that we knew better than this. It's disgusting to see grown adults fight over who gets to run a country none of them created, but even more heinous to see people subverting the very system that gave them this great country to run in the first place in the name of gaining power for a few years. It's like they're okay with destroying America if they get to be in power for four years and they don't think through what happens after. Makes no sense.
        </p><p>

Imagine if a trove of emails was discovered demonstrating the Trump family had sold their influence for cash in a scheme like this. Can you possibly <em>imagine</em> the media just skipping it? This would be headline news for <em>months</em> and rightly so. The House impeached Donald Trump over simply inquiring about Biden's activities on a recorded phone call with Ukraine whose transcript was made public &mdash; and now we find out that the Bidens have been knee-deep in Ukrainian corruption for decades, but media interest has evaporated?
        </p><p>

Is it possible the Democrats impeached Trump precisely <em>because</em> he was on the right track?
        </p><p>

Make no mistake: we are rapidly becoming everything we say we despise. Free speech has been curtailed, our press is no longer free or independent, and the Democrats appear to have unwittingly nominated a candidate who is simply ineligible by way of corruption.
        </p><p>

And while I understand how disappointing that is, we all need to see what's going on here for what it is: the elites in our country &mdash; the media, the politicians, even business leaders &mdash; are collaborating on something. And whatever they're doing, it definitely involves trying to pull the wool over the eyes of the American people, and they definitely want us to vote Biden for some reason.
        </p><p>

What I most admire about Americans is our adherence to principle; dedication to the principles of free speech and democracy do overwhelm  individual political affiliations and beliefs for many people. They care more about preserving our freedoms for the next generation than they do about having their way on political matters like tax plans and immigration details. But for others, America has become a frighteningly partisan place, where all questions are viewed in a partisan light.
        </p><p>

Which brings me to my buddy. He believes social networks are using models like the ones he has built to create echo chambers that specifically amplify messages beneficial to the Democrats' side. So there are many people on social media who &mdash; all day &mdash; see nothing but "news" (real or fake, who knows) that confirms every horrible suspicion about Trump and alleviates any concerns about Biden.
        </p><p>

We cannot judge these people &mdash; the evil is in manipulating, not being manipulated. That said, we must get through to them before November 3.
        </p><p>

You see, it's not link-blocking that's the evil part of social media &mdash; it's that these social networks define what goes on your news feed, and they're manipulating what you see so they can manipulate what you think. In this case, they have been manipulating what you think about politics using my buddy's algorithms. This cannot be allowed to go on.
        </p><p>

And so, I &mdash; a man who would never have considered voting for Donald Trump before &mdash; know that I need to. We need to send a message to the Democratic Party or they'll never reform, and we'll just be in this same position next election, deciding between a Republican (who may or may not  be a good candidate) and a corrupt-to-the-core Democrat. We can't reward this kind of behavior or it'll happen again.
        </p><p>

Choose wisely. The country depends on it.
