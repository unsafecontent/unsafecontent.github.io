        <p class="lead">
          Ibram X. Kendi, noted Boston University professor and founder of the Center for Antiracist Research, recently spoke to the Boston School Committee in support of a resolution to dismantle the public, merit-based charter schools that provide private school-quality education for free to underserved communities.
	      </p>
        <p>
          Charter schools &mdash; extremely prestigious public schools with a merit-based admissions process &mdash; have been America's preferred answer to disparities in quality of education for decades now. Indeed, charter schools were founded precisely with the intention of offering equal access to a first-class education. It's a simple idea: by allocating resources to the most dedicated students, we encourage hard work and create a pathway to the highest levels of success for everyone. It is the most American of approaches: purely meritocratic, designed to allow anyone with grit and determination to succeed.
        </p><p>

It would seem like this development would be applauded by activists like Kendi. But fast-forward a few decades, and while these schools have risen to prominence and are now considered the purveyors of America's most prestigious secondary school educations, Prof. Kendi is advocating their abolition.
        </p><p>

Kendi's stated reason for destroying charter schools as we know them is to defeat racism. The Professor explains in his poorly-worded diatribe, replete with grammatical errors unbecoming a man of his academic stature, that a simple principle is at play here: “if [charter schools] are reducing racial inequity then they are antiracist. If they are expanding or maintaining racial inequity, then they are racist.”
        </p><p>

When Kendi talks about “inequities,” he's talking about uneven outcomes when you arbitrarily group winners by ethnic background. It may seem capricious and arbitrary 
to separate people with 30,000 genes into four or five groups, but Kendi assures us that any other approach is abject racism.
        </p><p>
Indeed, the Professor's claim is that there exist two types of systems: antiracist and racist. Anything that is not antiracist is &mdash; by Kendi's definition and by the 
commonly accepted critical race theoretic definition &mdash; racist. Charter schools, he argues, may not do any particular thing to discriminate in favor of one race over
another, but they also don't do anything to proactively counterbalance historical injustices that happened years before these schools were founded. Thus, by not being
<em>antiracist</em> &mdash; or proactive in the narrow sense defined by Kendi &mdash; they are by his definition <em>racist</em>.
        </p><p>

Thus, by Kendi's logic, the only logical conclusion we can draw is that Pizza Hut is deeply racist and they must be stopped. Like TJ and Bronx Sci, Pizza Hut makes no particular effort to solve the social inequities that find their roots in 19th century American history. Since they do nothing to reduce racial inequities, they are, by the above definition, racist. Extending this reasoning along the natural axis, we can see that cucumbers, fellatio, and egg salad are also racist.
        </p><p>

If this all sounds absurd, it's  because it is. In mathematics, we call this brand of reasoning <em>reductio ad absurdum</em> &mdash; or “proof by contradiction.” By assuming Kendi's statement is correct, other results follow logically that we know to be false. So unless you have a reason to believe egg salad is racist, we can safely conclude that Kendi's statement was &mdash; in a pure and scientific sense &mdash; garbage. Basic logic does not admit any other explanation.
        </p><p>

Kendi also finds great fault with the standardized testing system, likening it to “allowing some NFL teams more time to practice in the offseason.” His logic is that students' access to test preparation resources is uneven, so the tests themselves are unfair.
        </p><p>

But Kendi needs to realize: his beef isn't really with standardized tests, it's with the notion of meritocracy in general. After all, any meritocratic system will require preparation, and access to resources will always be uneven. By Kendi's logic, therefore, all meritocratic systems must be abolished. From the Heisman trophy to the Nobel Peace Prize, the Professor sees no value in systems that reward high-quality work; in his view, any and every system should be designed with the sole focus of elevating those ethnic groups Kendi deems worthy of social approval.
        </p><p>

All this makes a curious mind wonder if Kendi isn't simply advocating Marxism in updated packaging; this rejection of meritocratic systems seems an awful lot like “from each according to their ability, to each according to their need.” It's not surprising that the first order of business is to tear down some of the greatest public schools we have: it's the “equal sharing of misery” that Winston Churchill warned of just a century ago.
        </p><p>

And while I do not agree with what Prof. Kendi says, unlike him, I will defend to the death his right to say it. I do not want to mince words. That said, it is clear that,
by playing on Americans's good nature, he has been able to trick decent, well-intentioned people into helping him bring real systemic racism back to American life, all under the guise of enhancing equity.
        </p><p>

One could even say his core philosophy is that equity of outcome matters more than equality of opportunity; Prof. Kendi views the equality of opportunity for white, Asian, and otherwise undesirable ethnic groups as the price we must pay to bring equity of outcome to black students.
        </p><p>

Forget the fact that you can let anyone into Harvard, but it doesn't make them smarter. Forget the fact that such a practice tarnishes the value of a Harvard degree 
in the hands of every black person who would've gotten in anyway. Forget all that. <strong>In America, equality doesn't have a price. It isn't negotiable.</strong> 
Equality of opportunity is a bedrock American principle that must be upheld at all costs.
        </p><p>

I think Prof. Kendi would be well served to either add rigor to his thinking and fully explain his core principles to the people &mdash; or recognize he was wrong and has unnecessarily stoked fear and hatred in our society. One or the other. You can't just sow race-hate but then not explain why.
